# MemoVault

![Mock Up Image](https://github.com/devnickocodes/memovault-app/blob/main/readme_docs/mock-up.png)



MemoVault is a social media app built with the React library, offering a wide range of user actions. Users can create and edit posts, follow or unfollow other profiles, like or unlike posts and comments, and delete content. They can also update their profiles, including username, password, and other details. Additionally, the app allows users to report posts and manage their reports. Admins are provided with tools to efficiently manage and review reported content.

## Agile Development 

[GitHub Projects](https://github.com/users/devnickocodes/projects/9/views/1) was used as one of the main Agile tools for the development for this project. The process was tracked using a Kanban board, utilising the "To Do", "In Progress" and "Done" columns.

Another Agile tool that was used in the making of this project is GitHub Issues where I used a custom made user story template to create all of the user stories.
