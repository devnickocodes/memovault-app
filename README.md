![Mock Up Image](https://github.com/devnickocodes/memovault-app/blob/main/readme_docs/mock-up.png)



MemoVault is a social media app built with the React library, offering a wide range of user actions. Users can create and edit posts, follow or unfollow other profiles, like or unlike posts and comments, and delete content. They can also update their profiles, including username, password, and other details. Additionally, the app allows users to report posts and manage their reports. Admins are provided with tools to efficiently manage and review reported content.

## Agile Development 

[GitHub Projects](https://github.com/users/devnickocodes/projects/9/views/1) was used as one of the main Agile tools for the development of this project. The process was tracked using a Kanban board, utilising the "To Do", "In Progress" and "Done" columns.


![Project Board](https://github.com/devnickocodes/memovault-app/blob/main/readme_docs/project_board.png)


Another Agile tool that was used in the making of this project is GitHub Issues where I used a custom made user story template to create all of the user stories.

- **Closed Issues**

## Color Scheme

MemoVault is designed with a vibrant and cohesive color palette that enhances the overall user experience and visual appeal. The selected colors bring a modern and engaging feel to the app, ensuring a consistent and enjoyable interface across features.


I have used [Coolors.co](https://coolors.co/9b22b9-808080-5e35b1-bfcde0-ae4eee-292727-fc3434-6c63ff-6a1b9a-d0f5d8) to create a showcase for the color scheme of the app.


![Color Palette](https://github.com/devnickocodes/memovault-app/blob/main/readme_docs/colors.png)


## Typography 

MemoVault utilizes the Nunito font, chosen for its clean and modern appearance. This font provides a friendly and approachable aesthetic, ensuring readability while complementing the app's vibrant design.


The font can be found [here](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Nunito)

## Reusable Components



## Future Feautres

### State Synchronisation 

- Full state synchronisation for posts to allow users to like popular posts directly without the need for page refresh.

### Notifications

- In-App Notifications: Introduce a notification center where users can view likes, comments, follows, and report updates in real-time. This would enhance user engagement and ensure they don't miss any important interactions.

- Push Notifications: Integrate push notifications for key activities such as new followers, likes, and comments. This feature can be expanded to include mobile notifications in a future mobile app version.


### Search and Discovery Enhancements

- Advanced Search Filters: Allow users to filter posts by date, popularity, hashtags, and user-specific tags to enhance content discovery.


### UI/UX Refinements

- Dark Mode: Implement a dark mode option to improve user experience.

- Profile Customization: Enable users to customize their profile page with themes, and additional profile fields like social media links and location.


### Security and Account Management


- Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): Introduce an option for users to enable 2FA, adding an extra layer of security to their accounts.


- Password Strength Indicator: When signing up or changing a password, display a strength meter that helps users create more secure passwords.


- Implement OAuth2 integration allowing users to sign in using their credentials from third-party providers like Google, Facebook, or Microsoft.


### Direct Messaging


- Implement a direct messaging system where users can privately communicate with each other, including features like group chats and media sharing.




## Frameworks, libraries and dependencies

### React-Infinite-Scroll-Component

- [React-Infinite-Scroll-Component](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-infinite-scroll-component) - Enables automatic loading of more posts as users scroll, enhancing user experience with smooth, endless content flow.

### React-Router-DOM

- [React-Router-DOM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router-dom) - Manages navigation within the app, allowing seamless transitions between pages without full reloads.

### ReactDOM

- [ReactDOM](https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/react-dom.html) Manages rendering of React components to the DOM, allowing elements like modals and notifications to be displayed effectively and interact with the overall page layout.

### Axios

- [Axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro) - Used to handle all the HTTP requests (like fetching data from the server) in the app. It simplifies the process of connecting to the backend, especially when dealing with things like authentication. For instance, if a user’s session expires, axios can automatically request a new session without making the user log in again, making the experience smoother.

### React Bootstrap

- [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap-v4.netlify.app/) - Provides pre-styled, responsive components to ensure the app looks and functions well on all devices.

### JWT-Decode

- [JWT-Decode](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jwt-decode?activeTab=readme) - Utilized to decode Base64URL-encoded JSON Web Tokens (JWTs).


### React-Scroll-To-Top
